			var i = 0;

			// Access the Intelligence & Decisioning platform, passing the X-Token-Id of the client
			// providing the current content. The platform will check the rules established for the client,
			// and determine whether the current user is entitled to view the content.

			function makeCall(){
				// Pass to the location of the Intelligence & Decisioning platform (a) the X-Token-Id for the current

			// ..and then continue to call the function, once every second. This means that the counter-value to be returned to the
			// Intelligence & Decisioning module is incremented each time (each new value is also displayed on the
			// current page).
			//
			// The rule for the client is established such that the user can consume the content until the counter
			// reaches 10, at which point a redirect is sent back, and the user is placed on the registration-page.
